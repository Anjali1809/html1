		<p style="color:blue">First, <b title="on content">you point out</b> how the inter-communal conflict in 
		Manipur is significantly<big> different</big> to inter-communal conflicts 
		weâ€™ve previously seen in other states. The first difference is 
		the<u style="color:black"> proportionately greater availability of armed weapons</u> among 
		the combatants on both sides of Manipur. And you add, the widespread 
		looting of police armouries recently witnessed in Manipur,
		perhaps has no parallel in <span style="color:black"><b>Indian history</b></span>. 
		Does this make <span style="color:black"><i>Manipur</i></span> particularly worrisome?</P>
